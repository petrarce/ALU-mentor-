; The following is an extraction of the NetlistBackAnno.txt file limited
; to those changes from the last forward annotation that involved changes
; of reference designator regardless of pin or gate swap within the same part.
; The exception being a local Common DataBase job which performs an implicit
; forward annotation after every back annotation.
; Changes could result from one or more runs of ECO/Renumber Ref Des
; and/or one or more runs of Route/Swap/Gates and/or one or more runs of
; Place/Automatic/Swap by Part Number.  If it is desired to document just
; the changes from one or more runs of ECO/Renumber Ref Des, run Forward
; Annotation to bring the schematic/netlist into sync with the board,
; make the runs of ECO/Renumber Ref Des, and then run Back Annotation.
; The first column represents the old reference designator.
; The second represents the new reference designator using a tab as a separator
; since references designators may have included spaces.  Leading spaces have
; been added to reference designators in order to improve readability
; NOTICE:
;
; 1. The file format is subject to change per product release.
; 2. The information is valid until the user makes changes that require
; back annotation.
; 3. For more complete information on all changes the user should reference
; the NetlistBackAnno.txt file.
