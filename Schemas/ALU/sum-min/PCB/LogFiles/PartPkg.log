     Packager     Version: 020806.00

        Commandline is: "C:\MentorGraphics\7.9.5EE\SDD_HOME\wg\win32\bin\Package.exe -j"D:\gorov\ALU-mentor--gorovenko-sum-min\sum-min\sum-min\sum-min.prj"  -n"Board1" -Add -NoFill "

     The Common Database is at "D:\gorov\ALU-mentor--gorovenko-sum-min\sum-min\sum-min\database".

     The Root of this design is "Schematic1".

     The Front End Snapshot of this design is "DxD".

     The PCB Design Path of this design is at "D:\gorov\ALU-mentor--gorovenko-sum-min\sum-min\sum-min\PCB\Board1.pcb".

     The Central Library is at "D:\gorov\ALU-mentor--gorovenko-sum-min\Library\Alu-Mentor.lmc".

     Unable to determine the Disable Repackage status.
     !Repackaging will be allowed!

     The PDBs listed in the project file will be searched to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the iCDB only for parts not already found in the
      Target PDB.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.

     The cross mapping of symbol pin names to Part Number pin
      numbers will be checked for packaged symbols and mapped correctly
      for unpackaged symbols.

     Properties that have been checked off in the Property Definition Editor
      found at Library Manager/Common Properties will be checked for value
      differences between the PartsDB and the non-null properties on symbols.
     Those properties checked off (other than Part Number)
      will not be transferred from the PartsDB to symbols.
     The following properties were checked off in the Property Definition Editor:
       "Pkg Group"
       "EPFIXEDWIDTH"
       "EPFIXEDLENGTH"
       "Term"
       "SIM_MODEL"
       "SIM_MODEL_FILE"
       "Array Component"
       "ICX_PART_MODEL"
       "Use Verilog"
       "Order"
       "Parametric"
       "Value2"
       "Tech"
       "IBIS"
       "VHDL Model"
       "Verilog Model"
       "Tolerance"
       "Value"

	Checking for errors in the ICDB...

	No errors found.  Proceeding with packaging...

     Checking for value differences between non-null symbol properties and PartsDB properties,
      but only for those properties checked off in the Property Definition Editor

     Checking the validity of the packaging of prepackaged schematic
      symbols.  Only the first error in symbols having the same
      Reference Designator will be reported.

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistent
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
      symbol pin names to Part Number pin numbers.
      Symbols that were not prepackaged will now be packaged correctly.
      
     No errors in Existing Schematic Packaging.

     The Common DataBase has been read and will be packaged.

     Updating the Common DataBase

     A BAM WasIs List: Integration\CDBBackAnno.bam has been created.
     There have been 24 reference designator changes and 288 pin
      number changes.
     The BAM file will list all of the from-to changes.

The Common DataBase has been successfully updated.

     Packager finished successfully.
     !THE iCDB IS UP-TO-DATE!
     
     An unused pin and gate report has been written to Integration\UnusedPins.txt
     An unused gate report for gates not in schematic has been written to Integration\UnusedGates.txt
     An augmented pin report has been written to Integration\AugmentedPins.txt.
