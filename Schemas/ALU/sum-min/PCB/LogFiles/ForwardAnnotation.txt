     The PDBs listed in the project file will be searched to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the iCDB only for parts not already found in the
      Target PDB.

     The schematic source is a Common Data Base.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.



     Common Data Base has been read

     Target PDB Name: Work\Layout_Temp\PartsDB.pdb

     Number of Part Numbers: 3
          Part Numb: AND -> Vend Part: AND 
          Part Numb: OR -> Vend Part: OR 
          Part Numb: XOR -> Vend Part: XOR 

     Number of Part Names: 0

     Number of Part Labels: 0


     Checking for value differences between symbol properties and PartsDB properties

     Checking the validity of the packaging of prepackaged schematic
      symbols.  Only the first error in symbols having the same
      Reference Designator will be reported.

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistent
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
      symbol pin names to Part Number pin numbers.
      Symbols that were not prepackaged will now be packaged correctly.
      
     No errors in Existing Schematic Packaging.

     The Common DataBase has been read and will be packaged.

     Creating a formatted Schematic Netlist (LogFiles\SchematicNetlist.txt)...
     A formatted Schematic Netlist has been created.

     The Logic DataBase has been compiled from the Schematic Design.
      Use Netload to bring the Component Design into sync.

     Logic Data has been successfully Compiled with no errors or warnings.
      Please proceed with your component Design.

  Updating Logic Database...

     Version:  99.00.05

     No changes made to Existing Schematic Packaging.


     There is no symbol data to be back annotated to the schematic source.


     The Logic DataBase has been updated and the Common DataBase has
      automatically been brought into sync with the Logic DataBase.
      Please proceed with your design.

     Finished updating the Logic Database.
